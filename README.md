# VR Physics Lab: Leakage of Condenser

An interactive Virtual Reality physics laboratory for undergraduate Engineering Physics students to measure high resistance using the method of leakage of a condenser.

## Experiment Overview
The simulation provides a 3D immersive environment where students can:
1. Charge a capacitor (Condenser) using Key K1.
2. Leak the charge through a high resistance using Key K2.
3. Observe deflection in a ballistic galvanometer.
4. Calculate the unknown resistance using the leakage formula.

## Features
